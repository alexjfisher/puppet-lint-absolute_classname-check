## Installing

### From the command line

```shell
$ gem install puppet-lint-absolute_classname-check
```

### In a Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'puppet-lint-absolute_classname-check', :require => false
```

## Checks

### Relative class name inclusion

Including a class by a relative name might lead to unexpected results [in Puppet 3](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/3/lang_namespaces.html#relative-name-lookup-and-incorrect-name-resolution). That's why a lot of manifests explicitly include by the absolute name. Since Puppet 4 names are always absolute and this is no longer needed. This lint check helps to clean up your manifests.

#### What you have done

```puppet
include ::foobar
```

#### What you should have done

```puppet
include foobar
```

#### Disabling the check

To disable this check, you can add `--no-relative_classname_inclusion-check` to your puppet-lint command line.

```shell
$ puppet-lint --no-relative_classname_inclusion-check path/to/file.pp
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re calling puppet-lint via the Rake task, you should insert the following line to your `Rakefile`.

```ruby
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_relative_classname_inclusion')
```
