A puppet-lint plugin to check that classes are included by their absolute name.


## Checks

### Relative class name inclusion

Including a class by a relative name might lead to unexpected results.

#### What you have done

```puppet
include foobar
```

#### What you should have done

```puppet
include ::foobar
```

#### Disabling the check

To disable this check, you can add `--no-absolute_classname-check` to your puppet-lint command line.

```shell
$ puppet-lint --no-absolute_classname-check path/to/file.pp
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re calling puppet-lint via the Rake task, you should insert the following line to your `Rakefile`.

```ruby
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_absolute_classname')
```
